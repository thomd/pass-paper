# Paper Backup for pass

An extension for [pass(1)](https://www.passwordstore.org/) - the standard Unix password manager - to backup all passwords to paper.

:warning: Always know what you are doing! Be aware of the risks!

## Install

    make install

The extension is installed into `~/.password-store/.extensions/` and must be enabled with (you might need add this into your `.bashrc`):

    export PASSWORD_STORE_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS=true

This extension is only tested for **macOS**.

### Uninstall

    make uninstall

## Output

`pass paper` prints only content above a separator (default separator is `=======`): all lines above the
separator are printed, all lines below the separator are **not** printed (including the separator).

### Example Output

    ---- private/example.com -------------------------------------------------
      mysecretpassword123
      username: joe

    ---- work/example.org ----------------------------------------------------
      supersecretpassword123
      user: joe

## Usage

:warning: Always pipe output to `lp(1)` or `lpr(1)` to avoid having password in plain text in a file. If `pass paper` is
used to print to `stdout`, you are prompted to confirm.

:warning: Before printing, verify your default printer.
